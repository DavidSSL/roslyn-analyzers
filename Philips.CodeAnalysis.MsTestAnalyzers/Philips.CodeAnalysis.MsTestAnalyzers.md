| Rule ID | Title                                                | Description                                                  |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| PH2000  | Avoid test method  prefix                            | Test Method names must not start with 'Test', 'Ensure', or 'Verify'. Otherwise, they are more difficult to find in sorted lists in Test Explorer. |
| PH2003  | Assert.AreEqual usage                                | Assert.AreEqual/AreNotEqual should be of the form AreEqual(<Expected Non-Null Literal>, <Actual Expression>) |
| PH2004  | Avoid ExpectedException attribute                    | The [ExpectedException()] attribute does not have line number granularity.  It also trips the debugger.  Use Assert.Throws() instead. |
| PH2005  | TestContext usage                                    | TestContext should be used or removed.                       |
| PH2008  | Assert.AreEqual parameter types must match           | The types of the parameters of Are[Not]Equal must match.  The AssertNotEqual pattern is particularly insidious, as the Assert may pass because they types unknowingly differ, even though the values are the same. |
| PH2009  | Assert.IsTrue/IsFalse Usage                          | Do not call IsTrue/IsFalse if AreEqual/AreNotEqual will suffice.  E.g., avoid Assert.IsTrue(x ==5).  Use AreEqual(5, x) instead for clearer error messages. |
| PH2010  | Assert.IsTrue/IsFalse Usage                          | Avoid unnecessary parantheses around <expected> and <actual> |
| PH2011  | Description Attribute usage                          | Description works awkwardly with Test Explorer. Avoid literal strings and keep them short. |
| PH2012  | TestTimeout required                                 | Every unit test must have a test timeout to help prevent CI/CD bloat.  Consider something such as the following to exempt active debugging and to give the CI/CD pipeline a small buffer:<br />`// Uncomment to run tests locally in a debugger. //#define DEBUGGING_TESTS     using Philips.Platform;   namespace Philips.RootMain.Test { 	public sealed class TestTimeouts 	{ #if DEBUGGING_TESTS 		public const bool IsDebuggingTests = true; 		public const int CiAppropriate = int.MaxValue; 		public const int CiAcceptable = int.MaxValue; 		public const int Integration = int.MaxValue; 		public const int Nightly = int.MaxValue; 		public const int Smoke = int.MaxValue; #else 		public const bool IsDebuggingTests = false;   #if BUILDSERVER 		public const int CiAppropriate = 1100; 		public const int CiAcceptable = 2200; #else 		public const int CiAppropriate = 200; 		public const int CiAcceptable = 1200; #endif 		public const int Integration = Durations.TenSecondsInMilliseconds; 		public const int Nightly = Durations.TwoMinutesInMilliseconds; 		public const int Smoke = Durations.FifteenMinutesInMilliseconds; #endif` |
| PH2013  | Avoid Ignore attribute                               | Tests marked as Ignore are dead code.                        |
| PH2014  | Avoid Owner attribute                                | Experience showed that this attribute's contents languished.  This could be enhanced to mimic PH2011. |
| PH2015  | Allowed Categories attribute                         | Tests must have a category, and the allowed category must match options specified in the .editorconfig.  E.g., `dotnet_code_quality.PH2015.allowed_test_categories=Unit,Integration`<br />Whitelisted tests are supported.  E.g., perhaps you have 100 legacy `Nightly` tests.  They run too slowly to be `Unit` tests.  You do not want to delete them; however, you do not want any more created.  Create a file named `TestsWithUnsupportedCategory.Allowed.txt`in the project.  Mark the file as an AdditionalInclude such that the Analyzer can see it.  Specify one TestMethod name per line. |
| PH2016  | Avoid TestInitialize attribute                       | This attribute is unnecessary in the C# programming language. They circumvent TestTimeouts, allowing for slower Test Runs.  They can contribute to non-deterministic test execution order, resulting complications while debugging. |
| PH2017  | Avoid ClassInitialize attribute                      | This attribute is unnecessary in the C# programming language. They circumvent TestTimeouts, allowing for slower Test Runs.  They can contribute to non-deterministic test execution order, resulting complications while debugging. |
| PH2018  | Avoid ClassCleanup attribute                         | This attribute is unnecessary in the C# programming language. They circumvent TestTimeouts, allowing for slower Test Runs.  They can contribute to non-deterministic test execution order, resulting complications while debugging. |
| PH2019  | Avoid TestCleanup attribute                          | This attribute is unnecessary in the C# programming language. They circumvent TestTimeouts, allowing for slower Test Runs.  They can contribute to non-deterministic test execution order, resulting complications while debugging. |
| PH2033  | DataTestMethod requires DataRows                     | DataTestMethods must have at least 1 DataRow.  TestMethods must not have any DataRows. |
| PH2034  | TestMethod requires TestClass                        | TestMethods not inside a TestClass are not executed.  They are dead code. |
| PH2035  | DataTestMethod requires correct parameter count      | DataTestMethods must have the same number of parameters of the DataRows, TestMethods should have no arguments. |
| PH2036  | TestMethod is public                                 | TestMethods must be public.                                  |
| PH2037  | TestMethods and DataTestMethods require unique names | TestMethods and DataTestMethods require unique names.        |
| PH2038  | TestClass is public                                  | TestClass must be public.                                    |
| PH2041  | Avoid MS Fakes                                       | Do not use MS Fakes as a Dependency Injection solution. Use Moq instead for example. |
| PH2050  | Avoid empty TestMethod                               | TestMethods must not be empty.                               |
| PH2055  | Avoid Assert.IsTrue(true)                            | Do not call IsTrue/IsFalse with a literal true/false.        |
| PH2056  | Avoid Assert.AreEqual(true, true)                    | Do not call AreEqual with a literal true/false.              |
| PH2058  | Avoid Assert conditional check                       | Do not use an inline null check while asserting. Use a different Assert.IsNotNull check. Assert.AreEqual(&lt;actual>?.attribute, &lt;expected>) => Assert.IsNotNull(&lt;actual>); Assert.AreEqual(&lt;actual>.attribute, &lt;expected>) |
| PH2059  | Public Method should be TestMethod                   | Public methods inside a TestClass should either be a test method or non-public. |
