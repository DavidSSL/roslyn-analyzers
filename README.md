#Introduction 
Roslyn Diagnostic Analyzers are customized compiler errors providing real-time feedback to C# developers.  Each Analyzer optionally includes an automatic Code Fixer.

#Getting Started
Use Package Manager and find these packages on nuget.org.  Use the .editorconfig file to enable/disable each of them and set their severity level.

#Build and Test
Build the software with Visual Studio 2019.  A Unit Test project is included.  A .vsix is also included if you need to test/debug the analyzers in an experimental instance of Visual Studio.
